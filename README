broodKernel (a i9001 kernel based on the latest i9001 stock kernel, but with lots of tweaks)
http://www.broodplank.net/
created by broodplank, Thanks to pikachu01 and skywalker01!
Only the ramdisk and some scripts have been used to tweak the kernel.

Want to build your own "broodKernel" ?

1. Clone the git
2. Watch in init.rc / init.qcom.sh (file only found on qcom devices) for tweaks, additional tweaks in /system/etc/(init.d)
3. Don't just copy the lines without paying attention, study all lines before copy pasting them
4. You can use WinMerge (for Windows) or diff (for Unix) to compare the files with yours
5. Compile boot.img with your zImage and adjusted ramdisk (cpio) (I Use kitchen in cygwin)
6. Profit I guess
